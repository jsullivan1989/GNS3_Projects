# Network Validation

<img width="783" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-28 at 9 59 02â€¯PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc60a04f-2543-49da-8900-d110907d2341">


Once the network is in place, there are several validations that need to take place to verify end to end connectivity between the PCs in their respective Customer VRFs.
The expected behavior is for the Customer A VRF networks 192.168.10.0/24 and 192.168.30.0/24 to communicate as well as Customer B's 192.168.20.0/24 and 192.168.40.0/24 networks.

Is that the case?

First we try to ping from PC1 (192.168.10.10) to PC3 (192.168.30.10).  In GNS3, you assign a host address on a PC with the command 
ip <address> <dotted decimal mask> <ip gateway>

## PC2 Network Configuration

```

PC2> ip 192.168.10.10 255.255.255.0 192.168.10.1
Checking for duplicate address...
PC2 : 192.168.10.10 255.255.255.0 gateway 192.168.10.1

# pinging the gateway, PE1

PC2> ping 192.168.10.1

84 bytes from 192.168.10.1 icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=1.126 ms
84 bytes from 192.168.10.1 icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.555 ms
84 bytes from 192.168.10.1 icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=0.325 ms
^C
```

## PC3 Network Configuration

```

PC3> ip 192.168.30.10 255.255.255.0 192.168.30.1
Checking for duplicate address...
PC3 : 192.168.30.10 255.255.255.0 gateway 192.168.30.1


PC3> ping 192.168.30.1 

84 bytes from 192.168.30.1 icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.361 ms
84 bytes from 192.168.30.1 icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.410 ms
84 bytes from 192.168.30.1 icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=0.406 ms
84 bytes from 192.168.30.1 icmp_seq=4 ttl=64 time=0.347 ms
```

Now let's do the same for the PCs that belong to Customer B (PC1 and PC4

## PC1 Network Configuration
```

PC1> ip 192.168.20.10 255.255.255.0 192.168.20.1
Checking for duplicate address...
PC1 : 192.168.20.10 255.255.255.0 gateway 192.168.20.1

PC1> ping 192.168.20.1

84 bytes from 192.168.20.1 icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.888 ms
84 bytes from 192.168.20.1 icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.562 ms
84 bytes from 192.168.20.1 icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=0.405 ms
^C

```

## PC4 Network Configuration

```

PC4> ip 192.168.40.10 255.255.255.0 192.168.40.1
Checking for duplicate address...
PC4 : 192.168.40.10 255.255.255.0 gateway 192.168.40.1

PC4> ping 192.168.40.1

84 bytes from 192.168.40.1 icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=9.204 ms
84 bytes from 192.168.40.1 icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.437 ms
^C


```

This is good.  Each customer PC can reach their configured gateway, so basic LAN connectivity is in place.  Now, the final test is to confirm that PC2 
and PC3 can communicate with each other, but not with PC1 or PC4.  And vice versa the other direction.  We want PC1 and PC4 to be able to talk, but have no way of communicating
with PC2 or PC3.  

Let's test from each PC.

## PC1 Validation

```
# pinging PC4 is successful, pings to PC2 or PC3 return an ICMP Destination Unreachable message from PE1 since no route exists in the Customer A routing-instance

```

The same story on the rest of our PCs.  So our (simple) network is up and running.  Now how did we get there?

## OSPF Validation

### PE1

From PE1, we have formed a neighborship with the P Router through Area 0.  Also by checking the OSPF Database, we see the Loopback addresses
from each of the three routers in our topology visible in PE1's Database.  The Loopbacks are Router LSAs originating from each router in Area Zero.
This is important for PE1 and PE3 to be able to have end to end connectivity to form their BGP peering through the loopback addresses.

PE1 then generates a route based off of the total metric that it can calculate based off of the LSA data in the OSPF Database.

The metric for the OSPF route is calculated based off of the sum of all "costs" of the interfaces in the path of the route. 
The cost is a function of the reference bandwidth divided by the interface bandwidth in order to scale down the metric.  
By default, Junos uses 100Mbps as the reference bandwidth, and every link in this small core setup is 1Gbps.  Therefore,
to calculate the cost you take 100 / 1000.  However, this gives us 0.1 and OSPF takes any cost calculated to be less than one and rounds up to one.

Therefore, the cost for all of our links in this lab is 1.  Since the loopback to PE2 is two hops away, the metric is 2.

As we can see, BGP is up and the proper routes are being exchanged in the Customer A and B VRFs.  We also see inet-vpn-unicast NLRI capability negotiated between
the two.  At a high level we can see that the routes are properly installed in the correct VRFs. 

In the Labels_and_Tables.md document, we'll take a deeper dive into how the LDP bindings, MPLS labels, and different routing-instances all interact in order to get this 
communication established.
